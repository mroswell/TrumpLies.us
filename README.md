The Toronto Star’s Washington Bureau Chief, Daniel Dale, has been following Donald Trump’s campaign for months. He has fact-checked thousands of statements and found hundreds of falsehoods.The paper put together <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/world/uselection/2016/11/04/donald-trump-the-unauthorized-database-of-false-things.html">this article.</a>. It takes a while to load, but when it does, it contains falsehoods spoken by Trump, and then some context surrounding each falsehood. The Star content was set up as an interactive, so the user has to click to see each bit of truthful context. There were so many falsehoods, that it would require a lot of clicks! So, together with a good Javascript Guru, SmartCaveMan, we created this site that lets you see both each falsehood, and the truth, without having to click hundreds of times. Feel free to print this out and share with your friends. Especially the ones who are considering voting for Trump.
