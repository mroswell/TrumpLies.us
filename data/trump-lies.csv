Over the next six years, their ranks increased to 320,000. The decline only occurred after the tech bubble burst and U.S. automakers lost market share among U.S. consumers.” It is not “going down” — the Detroit Free Press reports that auto jobs have increased sharply since the crash: “Since the rescue of General Motors and Chrysler in 2008-09, auto manufacturing jobs in Michigan have grown from 22,800 to 38,200 and auto parts jobs also have grown, from 73,400 to 162,800.”","Obama's record",""
